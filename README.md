## Installation

To run the code, an Anaconda distribution of Python is necessary. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.8.10.

The csv with the data from the survey I used for this analysis is available for download here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017. 
The csv schould be placed in a subfolder called "data" to run the jupyter notebook

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

- How satisfied professional developers are with thein job
- What are the influencing factors for job satisfaction unter the professional developers, that contributed to this study
- If there are differences in job satisfaction between the different developer types
- What role the salary plays in job Satisfaction

## File description

The repository contains one jupyter notebook that has all the code used for this analysis. It is structured according to the CRISP-DM-Process.

## Results

The main findings of this analysis can be found in the Blogpost here: https://medium.com/@ak_gossmann/what-adds-to-you-job-satisfaction-as-a-developer-512c833c9111

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link above. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
